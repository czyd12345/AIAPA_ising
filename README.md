# AIAPA_ising
A recurrent work of the article "A Spin Scale-Aware Self-Adaptive Ising Annealing Processing Architecture for Combinatorial Optimization Problems" \
  Already tested on FPGA \
  For algorithm level, run ising.py (Copy the data of any Gset on graph.txt) \
  For FPGA, change the parameters on aiapa.v and generate configuration datas(weights, initial spins) using a python script. \
